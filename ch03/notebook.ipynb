    "Words do not have a natural way of representing their meaning. In images, we already have representations in rich vectors (containing the values of each pixel within the image). **When parts of language are represented in a high-dimensional vector format, they are known as embeddings**. Through analysis of a corpus of words, and **by determining which words appear frequently together**, we can obtain **an $n$-length vector for each word, which better represents the semantic relationship of each word to all other words**. We saw previously that we can easily represent words as one-hot encoded vectors:\n",

While these embeddings can be of any size, they are generally of much lower dimensionality than the BoW representation. The BOW vectors are generally very sparse, consisting mostly of zeros, whereas embeddings are rich in data and every dimension contributes to the overall representation of the word. The lower dimensionality and the fact that they are not sparse makes performing deep learning on embeddings much more efficient than performing it on BOW representations"
